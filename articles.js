  <h1>Week 1</h1>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>This first week was spent setting up our development environment, developing the project website, and making the Gantt chart. Overall, everything went according to plan. The only change made is that we will no longer be using Docker. Due to compatibility challenges we reevaluated our need for Docker and realized that we would be able to work fine without it.</p>
  <h2>What was Accomplished:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gantt Chart</li>
      <li>Git Repository</li>
      <li>FastAPI and React communcation</li>
      <li>Website for weekly reports</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Problems Encountered:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Docker compatability issues</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Plans to Overcome Problems:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No longer using Docker. We determined that we wouldn't be losing annything by not using it.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Plans for next week:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Get API keys</li>
      <li>Begin backend development</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Member Contributions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cameron Calhoun - Website</li>
      <li>Jonathan Buckel - Weekly Report</li>
      <li>Gage Keslar - Gantt Chart</li>
